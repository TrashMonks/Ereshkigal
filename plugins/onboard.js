- \`onboard admit\` grants full entry to the server to the specified user.
- \`onboard kick\` kicks the user. The reason is required and will be DMed to them.
- \`onboard ban\` bans the user. The reason is required and will be DMed to them.
Whenever a user is admitted, they are also DMed to let them know.`,
