`This plugin is responsible for five different related functions:
- When an applicant is approved for server entry, it sends notice of this to a channel.
- When an applicant is denied, it kicks them. Because priority is based on server join date, this effectively puts them at the end of the queue should they rejoin.
- The \`onboard review\` subcommand lists applications that have yet to be approved or denied. If able, it will ensure that at least half of them (rounded up) are patrons.
- The \`onboard ticket\` subcommand lists applications that have been approved but for which the applicant has yet to be admitted into the server. Like the \`review\` subcommand, it prioritizes patrons.
- The \`onboard admit\` subcommand grants full entry to the server to the specified user.`,
