`This plugin is responsible for several different related functions:
- When a user is approved for server entry, it sends notice of this to a channel.
- When a user is denied, it kicks them. Because priority is based on server join date, this effectively puts them at the end of the queue should they rejoin.
- \`onboard view next\` shows the next \`amount\` users who will be let in.
- \`onboard admit next\` lets in the next \`amount\` users.
- \`onboard grab\` shows the applications of \`amount\` random users.
- \`onboard app\` retrieves the URL for the given user's application, if there is one.
The following user-related commands only work on users who are not full members:
- \`onboard admit\` grants full entry to the server to the specified user.
- \`onboard approve\` adds a user to the queue of users prioritized by the \`next\` commands.
- \`onboard kick\` kicks the user. The reason is required and will be DMed to them.
- \`onboard ban\` bans the user. The reason is required and will be DMed to them.
Whenever a user is admitted, they are also DMed to let them know.`,
