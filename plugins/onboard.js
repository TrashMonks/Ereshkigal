`This plugin is responsible for several different related functions:
- When an applicant is approved for server entry, it sends notice of this to a channel.
- When an applicant is denied, it kicks them. Because priority is based on server join date, this effectively puts them at the end of the queue should they rejoin.
- The \`onboard review\` subcommand lists applications that have yet to be approved or denied. If able, it will ensure that at least half of them (rounded up) are patrons.
- \`onboard ticket\` lists applications that have been approved but for which the applicant has yet to be admitted into the server. Like the \`review\` subcommand, it prioritizes patrons.
- \`onboard new\` works the same as \`onboard ticket\`, except it outputs the commands to get Ticket Tool to open tickets for the users.
- \`onboard app\` retrieves the URL for the given user's application, if there is one.
The following commands only work on users who are not full members.
- \`onboard admit\` grants full entry to the server to the specified user.
- \`onboard kick\` kicks the user. The reason is required and will be DMed to them.
- \`onboard ban\` bans the user. The reason is required and will be DMed to them.`,
